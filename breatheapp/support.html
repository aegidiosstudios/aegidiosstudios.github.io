            <section>
                <h2>Welcome to Breathe!</h2>
                <p>Paying attention to the breath helps us settle down, breathe deeper and feel better. Breathing exercises may enhance our current physiology and help us improve our physical and cognitive performance over time.</p>
                <p>You can do the exercises as often as you like - this is your tool to use whenever you need it.</p>
                <p>Be gentle with yourself. This is supposed to feel good, and if it doesn't or you get dizzy, that's a sign to slow down üòä</p>
            </section>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Note:</strong> Only practice breathing when it is safe and you don't have to pay attention to anything else. Not while driving or in water or any crazy shit like that. Sit or lie down. You may fall asleep. Ask a doctor if you are uncertain of your limitations.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="question">How do I pause a session?</div>
                <div class="answer">You can pause at any time by tapping the pause button. This is especially useful when you want to extend holds or take a break.</div>

                <div class="question">Can I use my own music?</div>
                <div class="answer">Yes! You can use your own music, the app's built-in sounds, or practice in silence. When using your own music, you'll still hear the gong sounds marking important moments in your practice.</div>

                <div class="question">What happens after completing the rounds?</div>
                <div class="answer">There's a relaxation phase that continues until you choose to stop. Take as much time as you need to fully relax and integrate your practice.</div>

                <div class="question">Can I customize the exercises?</div>
                <div class="answer">Yes! While we provide carefully designed preset patterns, you can also create your own custom exercises with full control over all parameters.</div>
