            <section>
                <h2>Welcome to Breathe!</h2>
                <p>Paying attention to the breath helps us settle down, breathe deeper and feel better. Breathing exercises may enhance our current physiology and help us improve our physical and cognitive performance over time.</p>

            </section>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Note:</strong> Only practice breathing when it is safe and you don't have to pay attention to anything else. Not while driving or in water or any crazy shit like that. Sit or lie down. You may fall asleep. Ask a doctor if you are uncertain of your limitations.</p>
            </div>

            <section>
                <p>Be gentle with yourself. This is supposed to feel good, and if it doesn't or you get dizzy, that's a sign to slow down üòä</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="question">How often can I do the exercises?</div>
                <div class="answer">You can do them as often as you like as long as it feels good. But with the longer and more intense exercises, more than once or twice a day is probably over the top. </div>

                <div class="question">Can I use my own music?</div>
                <div class="answer">Yes! You can use your own music, the app's built-in sounds, or practice in silence. When using your own music, it's best to mute the app's retention and relaxation sounds. </div>

                <div class="question">How should I breathe when doing the exercises?</div>
                <div class="answer">You can breathe as you like, but it is generally good to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth. Try to breathe deeply from your belly and up. Don't force anything. </div>

                <div class="question">How can I make a reverberating long hum?</div>
                <div class="answer">Use your mouth to give the exhale a little resistance and to create a vibration. If you do it right you can feel the vibration from chest to face.</div>
